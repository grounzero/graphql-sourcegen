## Example Projects

This repository includes several example projects that demonstrate different features and use cases of GraphQL Source Generator:

1. **Basic Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.BasicExample)
   - Demonstrates basic fragment generation without schema awareness
   - Shows property naming conventions, nullable handling, and documentation comments

2. **Schema-Aware Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.SchemaAwareExample)
   - Demonstrates schema-aware fragment generation with type inference
   - Shows how to use multiple schema files and custom scalar mappings

3. **Advanced Schema Features Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.AdvancedSchemaExample)
   - Demonstrates advanced schema features like interfaces, unions, and complex types
   - Shows how to handle complex nested structures

4. **Custom Scalar Mappings Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.CustomScalarExample)
   - Demonstrates mapping GraphQL scalar types to C# types
   - Shows integration with common C# types and libraries

5. **Nullable Types Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.NullableTypesExample)
   - Demonstrates how GraphQL nullability maps to C# nullable reference types
   - Shows best practices for handling nullable fields

6. **Fragment Composition Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.FragmentCompositionExample)
   - Demonstrates how to compose fragments using fragment spreads
   - Shows reuse of fragments across multiple types

7. **Integration Example** (GraphQLSourceGen.IntegrationExample)
   - Demonstrates how to integrate generated types with a GraphQL client
   - Shows how to use generated types in a real-world scenario
